Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial needed stronger software security to protect client financial data during online transfers.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I identified vulnerabilities and improved security using encryption and secure protocols.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Secure code protects sensitive data, builds trust, and prevents costly breaches.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Configuring HTTPS and resolving false positives in the dependency-check were both challenging and educational.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I implemented SHA-256 hashing, HTTPS, and dependency scanning to strengthen the app’s defenses.
I tested the app and used OWASP tools to ensure it worked securely without new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dependency-Check, Java Keytool, and SHA-256 encryption were valuable tools I’ll reuse.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This project shows I can refactor real-world code with strong security practices and tools.
